## Project Description

This assignment will focus on the existence, investigation, and mitigation of vulnerabilities in software projects. 

The objective is to develop a straightfoward web page for a health clinic. The frontend should provide basic information regarding the services, implementing also the possibility to contact the clinic, request an appointment with a doctor and download clinical exam results via code. The backend should implement any functionality relevant to this purpose. Additionally, other functionalities can also be added, as long as it makes sense inside the web page (no web page should exist with the sole purpose of showing a vulnerability).  

This application should also suffer from a specific set of weaknesses, which are not obvious to the casual user, but may be used to compromise the application, or the system.

This project should contain both a flawed and correct version of the application, together with a report demonstrating how those vulnerabilities are explored and their impact. The project must include vulnerabilities associated with [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html) and [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) along with others, so that the sum of the [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) is of at least 35.  


## Vulnerabilities Implemented


-  **CWE-79**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
-  **CWE-89**: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
-  **CWE-521**: Weak Password Requirements
-  **CWE-522**: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
-  **CWE-200**: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor 
-  **CWE-307**: Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts
-  **CWE-434**: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
